### Background
This project contains souce code and output for **[Entity Summarization](http://ws.nju.edu.cn/summarization/esbm/)***(top5, top10, all)* in **[dbpedia](./dbpedia)** and **[lmdb](./lmdb)**. Compared with the results shown in [official website](http://ws.nju.edu.cn/summarization/esbm/), We have achieved state-of-the-art results.<br>
The paper of this porject is in Proceedings of 1st International Workshop on EntitY REtrieval, Lingotto, Turin, Italy, 22 October 2018 (EYREâ€™18), 4 pages.<br>

### Explanation
- **[core](./core):** This direcotry is the main body of our project, includes:<br>
     - **Konwledge Base preprocessor** *(rdf_preprocess_dict.py, rdf_preprocess_object.py, rdf_preprocess_predicate.py)*<br>
     - **Category Supplementor** *(category_supplement.py)*<br>
     - **Data for MPSUM in json fomat** *(object_corpus_list_db.json, etc)*<br>
- **[dbpedia](./dbpedia) and [lmdb](./lmdb):** The dataset(Knowledge Base) used in our Entiry Summarization<br>
- **[MPSUM_output](./MPSUM_output):** The output of Entity Summarization using our MPSUM model(*Tips: You can remove this directory before running our project, and you can see this directory after the end of running our project as the output. The details about how to run our project will be dicussed below.*)<br>
## ENVIRONMENT AND CONFIGURATION
### Environment
- Ubuntu 16.04
- python 3.6 
- git
- VSCODE 1.25(optional)
### Configuration
Several python modules are required in our project as follows:
```python
pip install sklearn
pip install lda
pip install rdflib
```
## USAGE
```linux
git clone git@github.com:WeiDongjunGabriel/MPSUM.git
```
Before running this project, please remove the [MPSUM_output](./MPSUM_output) directory for your own output. The MPSUM_output we provide is for the workshop mentioned above to verify adn evaluate our output.
### Terminal 
if you use terminal to run our project, please follow these steps:
```linux
cd MPSUM
cd core 
python lda_test_and_output.py
```
### VSCODE
if you use VSCODE as you IDE, please follow these steps:
1. open the MPSUM folder with your VSCODE
2. open the python file named "lda_test_output.py"
3. run this python file in your VSCODE
## OUTPUT AND EVALUATION
### Output
The output is in the folder named "MPSUM_output" as your running this project with the above steps.
### Evaluation
You can evaluate your own output's F-measure and MAP by following instructions in [ESBM Benchmark](http://ws.nju.edu.cn/summarization/esbm/).
## ACKNOWLEDGEMENT
This is our Summer internship project in IIE, my tutor [Longtao Huang](http://people.ucas.edu.cn/~huanglongtao) and group members has helped me a lot. Without them, I am certainly unable to complete this project.<br>
What's more, a gorgeous girl passing by has given me a great incentive to go ahead.<br>
